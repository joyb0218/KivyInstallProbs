Had many issues, but managed to work them out. Here's what I learned (using PyCharm):

1) You can't install Kivy on Python 3.8. If you have 3.8, go back to 3.7.

2) I installed all of the packages that someone else posted a picture of. I'll post mine here. 
Go to your project interpreter and hit the "+" button to add them all. They should successfully install.

3) Was getting the window sdl2 error. Watched this short video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_jv8KsYBrs&t=212s) 
(may God bless this person) and changed my paths in my system  environment.

4) I then reinstalled the dependencies from the Kivy website -- AND IT WORKED!!!

Hope this helps someone!!!!
